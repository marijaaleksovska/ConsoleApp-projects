We need to create an application to manage our pizzeria. Users of the application are the employees. 
The scenario that we have to cover is as follows. The employee takes order from the customer and enters pizza type, pizza size, toppings, customer address and customer phone number. After taking the order the employee assigns the order to the delivery guy that delivers the pizza. After the pizza is delivered the delivery guy mark the order as complete. 

The application should have the following functionalities:

  1.Create order

    Ask the user for a pizza type 
    Ask the user for pizza size
    Ask the user for toppings
    Ask the user for address 
    Ask the user for a phone number
    Based on the information create a new order and assign it to an available delivery guy
    Print the receipt to the user
    
  2.Mark order as complete

    When delivery guy delivers the pizza, should mark the order as completed
    
  3.Manage pizza
  
    Create a new pizza type and size
    Remove existing pizza
    
  4.Manage delivery guys
  
    Add new 
    Remove
