Create an application that will help the employees of the library manage book stocks, manage members, rent books, track rented books and close book rents. Users of the application will be the employees of the library. 

Every book has:

    Unique Id
    Title
    Number of copies
    
Books can be rented only by library members and each member can rent up to 3 books at a time. 

Each member has: 

    Unique Id – which the member needs to give when renting a book
    Name
    Surname
    Email – there can not be two members with the same email address
    
The application should have the following functionalities: 

  Rent

      Input member Id (validate if there is a member with input Id and if the member can rent more books)
      Present available books for rent so the member can choose
      Based on the member’s choice mark the book as rented and assign it to the member

  Close rent	

      Input member Id (validate)
      Show the list of books that the user has rented
      Based on the member's input close the rent of the book and unassign it from the member

  Manage members

      Show all members
      Create new member
      Delete existing member

  Manage books

      Add new book (can not have multiple books with the same title)
