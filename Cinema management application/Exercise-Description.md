We need to create an application to help manage our cinema.
The cinema has 5 halls. Each hall has a number of seats, movie currently playing. 
Each movie playing in a hall has Title, Duration, Genre and Price. 
Besides movie tickets, the cinema can sell different kinds of snacks and drinks. 
We have a limited amount of each snack. The cinema is also displaying the list of the next 10 movies to be played.

We need to present the ability to the customer to: 

    1.Buy ticket

        Choose from available halls
        Choose the number of seats to buy
        Choose snacks (as many as the user wants)
        After the user finishes the order we need to save the receipt containing all of the previous information, plus the customerâ€™s name and the price.
